## start the server:

1. Open a terminal in this folder
2. Run the command `npm run start:dev`
3. Wait till the terminal says `connected to db`

## To go to the pages:

go to `localhost:3000/6221108139`

> The user `6221108139` is the bot user for shrivatsa, so it has the transactions recorded that we used while making the interim demo

You can leave the filtering button for now, i think we won't really need it anyways

## Structure of the code

The HTML `.ejs` pages are in the folder `views/`
The JasaScript, css, and asset files are in the folder `public/`

> do **not** change the structure of the code, the files work only if they are in the corresponding folders
